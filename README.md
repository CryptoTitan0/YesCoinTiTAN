# How to Use

## Command Line Options / Arguments

This script/program supports several argument parameters that can be used. Here's an explanation of the arguments:

`--data` / `-D`: Used when you have a different filename for storing account data. By default, the filename used by this script/program to store account data is `data.txt`. For example, if you have a file named `query.txt` as the file storing account data, just run `bot.py` with the `--data` / `-D` argument. Example: `python bot.py --data query.txt`

`--proxy` / `-P`: Used when you have a different filename for storing the proxy list. The filename used by this script/program to store the proxy list is `proxies.txt`. For example, if you have a file named `prox.txt` as the file storing the proxy list, you just need to add the `--proxy` / `-P` argument parameter to use your proxy file. Example: `python bot.py --proxy prox.txt`
